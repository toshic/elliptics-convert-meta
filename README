Utilities to convert metadata for upgrade from elliptics 2.9 to 2.10

There is 3 steps to convert metadata from 2.9 to 2.10:

1. Convert Kyoto Cabinet meta.kch to eblob meta using dnet_convert_meta utility
	dnet_convert_meta -M /path/to/meta.kch -N /path/to/eblob-meta
   This step is mandatory.

2. Convert Kyoto Cabinet history.kch to create META_UPDATE timestamps that are required for correct checks
	dnet_convert_history -M /path/to/eblob-meta -H /path/to/history.kch -g 1:2
   If there is records in history.kch that doesn't exists in meta.kch this utility will create it. -g specifies groups for such records.
   This utility is not mandatory but it's highly recommended to run it.

3. Run over files on filesystem/eblob to add missed meta records and optionally update checksums
	dnet_convert_files --input-path /path/to/files/root --meta /path/to/eblob-meta --group 1 --group 2 
   Input path should point to root directory in case of filesystem backand or to eblob in case of eblob backend.
   If there is files that doesn't have records in meta thils utility will create it. --group parameter specifies groups for such records.
   There are optional parameters:
     --threads (default it 16) - number of threads that iterates over eblob/filesystem
     --enable-checksum - enable checksum calculation and update. If old checksum differs this utility will overwrite it.
